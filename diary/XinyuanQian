week2
Group formed. I created the Trello & Bitbucket accounts for the team as long as helped teammates getting familiar with Git commends.
I also discussed with the team several available software tools and libraries that we can use for the three topics.
Proposal depends on the final decission of the choice of topics. More details needed on next week's lab.
